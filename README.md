## Physics Interpreter and Visualizer
We present a physics interpreter that can evaluate various types of user input in order to solve problems.
The user can choose from many topics from simple motion to electromagnetism to nuclear physics.
When applicable, there will also be a visualization of certain physics concepts.

### How It Works
There are three main aspects of this project that make it work:
1) Interface with navigable menu for choosing topics.
2) Solving data input using various functions.
3) Output of data and visualization.
