Prioritization:
	Have a working product with basic interface and simplest possible user interaction.
        Start with groundwork: defining Vectors, Units, creating basic interface.
        Work on implementing methods for solving problems.
                        
Core Functionality:
	Working user interface with navigation, input, and output.
        Tree management of topics.
        Searchable catalog of topics.
        Implement topics.
                
Non-essential:
	Animations.

Prerequisites:
	Create necessary classes for vectors, units, constants, enums.
	Low complexity concepts before high complexity: motion > forces > energy > ...

Delegated Tasks:
	Chester :: class Vector
        Dawei :: user interface
